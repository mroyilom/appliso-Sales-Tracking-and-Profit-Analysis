# appliso-Sales-Tracking-and-Profit-Analysis
A lightweight POS web app built with Google Apps Script and Google Sheets. The app records sales, appends sales and payment rows to sheets, and displays live totals on the receipt. Use this repo to run a small shop prototype or to adapt core flows for a larger system.
